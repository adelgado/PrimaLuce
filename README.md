Software Development Platform for ARM Terminals.

A event-based (libeio) development framework on top of the Android Kernel (work in progress) for Android enabled devices, where developers can write applications in C, C++ and Lua. 

The system runs on the Linux/Android Kernel and is compiled with all the necessary libraries (i.e. glibc, SDL, libeio, libev, libpng etc.) in such a way that written applications make no use of the Android (Java/NDK) System.
